  <h1>Hobbies</h1><br>
  <p>There have been several thing that I enjoy as my hobbies and those include things like:
    <ol>
  <li><a href="#comp" style="color:#d6d6d6">Building computers</a></li>
  <li><a href="#car" style="color:#d6d6d6">Riding motorcycles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#friends" style="color:#d6d6d6">Doing things with friends</a></li>
</ol>

    <div class ='div-1'>
    <br><br><br><h3 id="comp"><b>Building Computers</b></h3>
    <p>Throughout the years I have built several computers which have allowed me to connect with
    people across the globe. Part of the enjoyment of computer for me is to find out how they go together.
    I enjoy calling building computer adult legos because the two are fairly similar in how they are put together
      and if you mess up then its alot more expensive.</p>

    </div>
  <div class ="div-1">
    <br><br><h3 id="car"><b>Riding motorcycles and driving cars</b></h3>
    <p>Another thing that I love doing is operating pretty much anything with a motor. This has extended
      to me loving cars and motorcycles and as a result, I have been able to find friends pretty much everywhere I go.</p>

    </div>
  <div class ="div-1">
    <br><br><h3 id="friends"><b>And having fun with friends</b></h3>
    <p>The last thing here although by far not the last thing I enjoy is having fun and causing chaos with my friends.
    Most of my friends love at least one of the things that I love doing and by having that common ground it has created
    Brothers and an environment of chaos.</p>

<div id="About" class="tabcontent">
  <h1>Achievements</h1>
  <p>There have been many things that I have done in life but the biggest one that comes to mind is that of my Eagle
  Project. <br><br><img src="Eagle%20Project.JPG" style="width: 30%"><br><br> For my Eagle Project I made 50 Fleece blanket kits and paired them with
  stuffed animals. Those then were brought to the foster care system that was incharge of my state. It was not a easy task
  even though we knew exactly what to do. I have been making these blankets since I was a little kid and could make them in my sleep.
  The psychology behind why we included the stuffed animals was interesting to learn. There have been studies that have
  said that if a child is given something to care for such as a stuffed animal or toy it helps them process and have a better
  outlook towards the whole ordeal. This is because it gives them a way to process some of the hard emotions that come along with a situation like this.<p>

<!--<p>Overall this page is quite boring in comparison. I have several things that are of interest to me ranging from
  random knowledge to things that tend to be useful.<br> One of the more random interests would be that I occasionally will look
  up local laws to answer random questions such as for utah if the speedlimit is under 45, or the road is an off-ramp,<br> then motorcycles can filter to the front of
  a stoplight at 10mph or less.One of the more useful interests that I have is that I want to get trained on all sorts of
  industrial equipment.<br> I worked at lowes over this last summer and within two weeks of starting I was certified on all the
  heavy machinery. <p>-->
